# Comparison: Open Social Networks and OER Aggregation

Open social networks like Bluesky (AT Protocol) and Nostr enable broadcasting events to listeners. These events and their contents can be aggregated to provide secondary services and applications.

## Bluesky (AT Protocol) Examples

## Open Educational Resources (OER)

While most applications built on these networks are B2C-focused, the same technology can be used to share academic and educational content:

- **Research papers** - e.g., https://semble.so
- **Open Educational Resources** - freely accessible learning materials
- **Version control systems** - e.g., https://tangled.org

The inherently open nature of OER makes it ideal for distribution via decentralized networks. However, retrieving OER content by directly filtering relay data is not practical at scale.

**This project provides an aggregator and API layer** to make OER discovery and retrieval efficient and user-friendly on the Nostr network.
